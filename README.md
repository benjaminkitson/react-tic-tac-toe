A Tic-Tac-Toe web app!

The app supports both one and two players, with a cpu opponent in one-player mode.

The two-player mode is fairly self explanatory - the turns alternate until either one player wins, or there is a draw.

The one-player mode is more interesting - at present, the user will start, playing as 'X'. The cpu will respond to the game state, and both actively try to win, while 'defending' itself when it detects that the user is about to win. At present there is no option for the cpu to start - that will come later.

At the time of writing this (6/4/22) the code is a bit messy - I've spent more time on just trying to get the CPU to work properly then I have on keeping the code clean - tidying it up will be my next move.

Cheers for looking!
